# PwnBERT
A project based on BERT to detect GLIBC vulnerabilities.
## What is BERTPwn
BERTPwn is a BERT-based vulnerability detection tool designed to identify and analyze Pwn-related vulnerabilities (e.g. UAF, heap overflow, etc.) in C language. By combining natural language processing techniques and security domain knowledge, this project aims to provide an efficient and reliable solution to help developers and security researchers identify potential security risks and thus strengthen code security.

##Where are we currently?
Currently, we are still on the development stage of the project.
