Generate only 1 C code program that demonstrate Off-by-One heap vulnerabilities commonly found in CTF competitions . Each code snippet should be functional and unique in terms of the used variables, function names, and structure. For all snippets, ensure the following elements are included:Allocate memory for a heap buffer using malloc.Use a loop to write data into the buffer, ensuring the loop iterates one more time than the buffer size, causing an Off-by-One error.The code should include a function that may be called with an incorrect parameter due to the Off-by-One error.Create a struct that is stored on the heap, where the Off-by-One error will affect a critical field in the struct.Incorporate a variety of variable names, function names, and comments to increase diversity in the generated code.Please ensure the generated code snippets are syntactically correct, have proper indentation, and are representative of real-world Off-by-One vulnerabilities encountered in CTF competitions. Separate each code snippet with a line of 10 asterisks (**********). The code should be in English and follow standard C coding conventions. You should only output codes, nothing else. The pure-code section need to start as code_start, ends with code_ends, also, inside of the code section, there shouldn't be any explaination, nothing other than , etc
